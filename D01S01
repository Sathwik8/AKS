Run our first container 

$docker container run hello-world
Image Naming convention of DockerHUB
reponame:tag
eg hello:world
hello-world is the name of repo
and there is no tag specified if no tag specified then the tag is latest

docker first check the image locally if present run the container if not present then it will check docker hub and find hello-world public repo and download the image with latest tag locally and then run the container
Every docker image contains a default command that will be executed when you run the container using the image. if the command is  along running process then your container wll be in running state . if the command is a short running process it will start do its job and the process terminates and hence the container also exits

to list all running container
$ docker container ls 

To list all containers

$ docker container ls -a

Running containers with a different command

$ docker container run docker.io/library/ubuntu:18.04

the default command for the ubuntu image is /bin/bash and you will notice that the ccontainer run and terminates 

$ docker container run docker.io/library/ubuntu:18.04 ps -aux

$ docker container run docker.io/library/ubuntu:18.04 ls -l

$ docker container run docker.io/library/ubuntu:18.04 sleep 20

you will notice that the container is runnin for 20 secs

the container will run in foreground mode and you will not get the command prompt till teh command completed to address this we need to run the container in backgrund mode or detach mode










Running the container in detached mode

$ docker container run --name webserver tomee:latest

the container will start in foreground mode that means the terminal will be used as the output device of the container. Try to press ctrl+c
and you will see the container gets exited

$ docker container ls -a

To start the container in detach mode(recommended for all containers)

$ docker container run --name webserver1 -d tomcat:latest

to login to the running containers
docker container exec -it container_id bash or sh

Login to the existing running containers

$docker container run -d centos sleep 600

check the container status
$docker container ls

check the id and use the following command
$docker container exec -it container_id bash

you will be inside the container . execute the command
ps -ef

you will see sleep 600 is the pid 1 process and bash is with different id

exit from the container 

exit 

you will notice the container is not termincated because the PID1 process is not impacted


Run container in interactive mode

$docker container run --name test -it docker.io/library/centos

you ar in container shell prompt

execute 

ps -ef

and see /bin/bash is the parent process having pid 1. if the parent process gets stoppeed the container slao exits

type exit

$ docker container ls -a

you will see the container exits





$ docker container ls

To check the logs

$ docker container logs webserver1

or

$ docker container logs containerid

to stop the container

docker container stop containername/id

$ docker container stop 54ce1

to start the container

docker container start containerid/name

$ docker container start 54ce1

to delete the container

first stop the container and then delete it

$  docker container stop web
$ docker container rm web

to check the container resource usage

$ docker container stats

To delete all the stopped container at one go

$ docker container prune

Docker directory where all information of containers are stored

$ sudo ls -l /var/lib/docker

exposing the application to outside world

Delete all the containers

docker container ls -aq|xargs docker container stop
docker container ls -aq|xargs docker container rm
